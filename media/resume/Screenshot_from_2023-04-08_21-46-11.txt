SECOND READING 1 Conntisess =
“Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump.”

A reading from the First Letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians

Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?


Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened.

For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.

Let us therefore celebrate the festival,
not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

The word of the Lord.
